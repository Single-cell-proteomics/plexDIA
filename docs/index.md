------------

Mass-spectrometry offers powerful methods for protein analysis, but their throughput remains limited. It can be increased by analyzing multiple peptides simultaneously, as afforded by data independent acquisition (DIA), and by analyzing multiple samples simultaneously, as afforded by multiplexing methods. Combining these two strategies has the potential to increase throughput multiplicatively with the number of labels. Here we introduce plexDIA, a universal method for sensitive and multiplexed DIA analysis. We demonstrate that 3-plex labeling of sub-microgram samples increases the number of quantitative protein ratios by about 3-fold, enabling the quantification of over 25,000 protein data points per hour of active gradient on a first-generation Q Exactive mass spectrometer.

## About the project

plexDIA is a project developed in the [Slavov Laboratory](http://slavovlab.net) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu/) in collaboration with Demichev and Rasler Laboratories at Charité, Universitätsmedizin. It was authored by [Jason Derks](https://slavovlab.net/people.htm), [Harrison Specht](http://harrisonspecht.com), [R. Gray Huffman](https://slavovlab.net/people.htm), [Markus Ralser](https://www.crick.ac.uk/research/labs/markus-ralser), [Vadim Demichev](https://github.com/vdemichev) and [Nikolai Slavov](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/slavov-nikolai/).
